1.Created a data folder and synthetic data
2.intialized dvc (pip install dvc)
3. now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
4. now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3"  
5.Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
6. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
7. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
8.Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
9.  Now make changes to dvc_rough.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
10.Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
11.Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
12.Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
13. Now repeat step 9-11 for v3 of data.
